 				lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.


Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by Englis

 					Amazon.com, Inc.[6] (/ˈæməzɒn/ AM-ə-zon) is an American multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft.[7][8][9][10] The company has been referred to as "one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world", as well as the world's most valuable brand.[11][12]

Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[13] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, Amazon has expanded into a multitude of product categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker, "The Everything Store".[14] The company has multiple subsidiaries including cloud computing company, Amazon Web Services; autonomous vehicle company, Zoox; satellite internet company, Kuiper Systems; and computer hardware R&D company, Amazon Lab126. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[15]

Amazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and mass scale.[16][17][18][19] As of 2021, it is the world's largest Internet company, online marketplace, AI assistant provider, cloud computing platform,[20] and live-streaming service as measured by revenue and market share.[21] In 2021, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200 million subscribers worldwide.[22] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States,[23] one of the world's most valuable companies, and as of 2021, the world's most valuable brand.[24]

Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon Studios, and is currently in the process of acquiring film and television studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Amazon also produces consumer electronics, most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TV.

Amazon has been criticized for practices including technological surveillance overreach,[25] a hyper-competitive and demanding work culture,[26] tax avoidance,[27] and anti-competitive behavior.[28][29]
